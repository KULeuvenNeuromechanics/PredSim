## Benchmarking

info about why benchmarking and refer to paper





### Idea benchmarking workflow

The main idea is that you can test your simulation workflow on a set of gait conditions and compare your simulations to experiments. 

**Input:**

- Simulation model

- Settings used for you simulations 

**Output**

- Simulation results

- experimental values associated with motion, preferably scaled for the person (non-dimentionalised for paper and re-computed for antropometry of specific model used in simulation)
  
  - spatio-temporal
  
  - kinematics
  
  - kinetics
  
  - metabolic power

**benchmark conditions:**

- gait at various speeds [Abe2025, VanDerZee?]

- walking on a slope [Koelewijn?, McDonald?]

- walking with added mass [schertzer dataset ?]
