## Function information



### Gait 92 model

(https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Gait+2392+and+2354+Models)

- f_PredSim_Gait92.m solves the predictive simulations with the gait 92 model
- f_TrackSim_Gait92.m solves the tracking simulations with the gait 92 model [not finished yet]
- f_LoadSim_Gait92.m post processing/analysis from the simulated states and controls (both tracking and predictive simulations). 



### Rajagopal

(https://simtk.org/projects/full_body)

- f_PredSim_Rajagopal.m sovles the predictive simulations with the gait 92 model
- f_TrackSim_Rajagopal.m solves the tracking simulations with the Rajagopal model

- f_LoadSim_Rajagopal.m post processing/analysis from the simulated states and controls (both tracking and predictive simulations).
