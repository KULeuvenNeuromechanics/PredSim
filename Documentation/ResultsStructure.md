## R: results

The results are organised in a struct *R* that contains matrices for the different variables. 
The dimensions of the matrices depend on the model and settings that were used. 
In the overview below, the dimensions are expressed in function of:
- mesh: the number of meshpoints used to express the result.
If *S.misc.gaitmotion_type* is *FullGaitCycle*, the results use *S.solver.N_meshes* meshpoints.
If *S.misc.gaitmotion_type* is *HalfGaitCycle*, the results use *2\*S.solver.N_meshes* meshpoints.
- coordinates: the number of coordinates.
- muscles: the number of muscles.
- ligaments: the number of ligaments.
- actuators: the number of (coordinate) torque actuators.

The order of *mesh* represents 1 gait cycle, starting at the right side initial contact.
The order of *coordinates*, *muscles*, and *ligaments* is given in *R.colheaders*.
