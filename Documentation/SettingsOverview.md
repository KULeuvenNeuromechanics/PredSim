- **osim_path**: 
	- Path to the scaled opensim model of the subject.

	- **S.subject.TrackSynW**: boolean that indicates if synergy weights are tracked. Default is *0* (no weights tracking).
	- **S.subject.TrackSynW_side**: indicates if weights are tracked for one or both legs. Possible options are: 'onlyLeft', 'onlyRight' or 'RightLeft'. Use this variable only if a full cycle is predicted (S.misc.gaitmotion_type = 'FullGaitCycle'). Default is *'RightLeft'* [char];
	- **S.subject.knownSynW_r**: synergy weights to be tracked are specified here, using the following form: {'muscleName1', weightArray1, {'muscleName2a', 'muscleName2b'}, weightArray2, etc.}. The 'weightArray' is an horizontal vector containing the muscle weight (between 0 and 1) on each synergy.
	- **S.subject.knownSynW_l**: same as 'S.subject.knownSynW_r' but for the left leg. Use this variable only if a full cycle is predicted (S.misc.gaitmotion_type = 'FullGaitCycle')
	- **S.subject.TrackSynW_NSyn_r**, **S.subject.TrackSynW_NSyn_l**: number of right and left synergy weights that are tracked for the muscles defined in 'S.subject.knownSynW_r' and 'S.subject.knownSynW_l'. This number may be different from 'S.subject.NSyn_r' or 'S.subject.NSyn_l'.

#### S.weights

- **S.weights.E**: 
    - weight on metabolic energy rate. Default is *500* [double]
- **S.weights.E_exp**: 
    - exponent for the metabolic energy rate. Default is *2* [double]
- **S.weights.q_dotdot**: 
    - weight on joint accelerations. Default is *50000* [double]

    - weight on torque actuator excitations. Default is *10^6* [double]
- **S.weights.pass_torq**: 
    - weight on passive torques. Default is *1000* [double]. The passive torques term includes the coordinate limit torques, and potentially the coordinate damping torque.
- **S.weights.pass_torq_includes_damping**: 
    - specify if damping torque = damping coefficient * coordinate velocity is to be included in the cost function (0 or 1). Default is 0 [double].
- **S.weights.a**: 
    - weight on muscle activations. Default is *2000* [double]
- **S.weights.a_exp**: 
    - exponent for the muscle activation. Default is *2* [double]
- **S.weights.slack_ctrl**: 
    - weight on slack controls. Default is *0.001* [double]

#### S.OpenSimADOptions
These settings are passed to OpenSimAD.

- **S.OpenSimADOptions.compiler**: 
    - command prompt argument for the compiler. [char]
    By default, PredSim will look for the most recent version that is installed in either `C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/` or `C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/`.
    If you get an error about not finding a compiler, use this setting to specify your compiler:
       - Visual studio 2015: 'Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64'
       - Visual studio 2017: 'Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64'
       - Visual studio 2017: 'Visual Studio 16 2019'
       - Visual studio 2017: 'Visual Studio 17 2022'
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.verbose_mode**:
    - print outputs from windows command prompt to matlab command window (and log file). Default is *false* [bool].
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.verify_ID**:
    - verify the generated function versus the inverse dynamics tool in OpenSim. Default is *false* [bool].
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.jointsOrder**: 
    - If you want to choose the order of the joints outputs. Default is empty, which uses the joint order of the .osim file. [cell array of char]
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.coordinatesOrder**: 
    - If you want to choose the order of the coordinate outputs. Default is empty, which uses the coordinate order of the .osim file. [cell array of char]
    S.OpenSimADOptions.jointsOrder and S.OpenSimADOptions.coordinatesOrder are included in the settings to aid backward compatibility.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.input3DBodyForces**:
    - add 3D force vectors that act on bodies. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.input3DBodyMoments**:
    - add 3D moment vectors that act on bodies. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.export3DPositions**:
    - export 3D position of points in bodies, in ground reference frame. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.export3DVelocities**:
    - export 3D velocity of points in bodies, in ground reference frame. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.exportGRFs**: 
    - Export total ground reaction forces of left and right side. Default is *true* [bool]
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.exportSeparateGRFs**: 
    - Export ground reaction forces of each contact element. Default is *true* [bool]
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.exportGRMs**: 
    - Export total ground reaction moments of left and right side. Default is *true* [bool]
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.exportContactPowers**: 
    - Export power due to vertical compression of each contact element. Default is *true* [bool]


#### S.orthosis
Interface to add custom orthoses to the simulation model.

- **S.orthosis.settings**:
    - Cell array of structs, where each struct contains the settings for one orthosis. Each orthosis should have a setting *function_name* [char] that refers to the function that describes the orthosis. See [functions in PredSim/WearableDevices for examples](../WearableDevices/). The other fields are passed to this function, so they can be used to set parameter values. See example functions and `help Orthosis` for how to define custom orthoses.
