**How to use the code**

The code is written such that as a user you only have to interact with `main.m <https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/master/main.m>`__.
All user-defined `settings <./SettingsOverview.md>`__ are stored in structure *S*. In main.m you have to specify the required settings and are free to change/add the optional settings.

Unspecified settings use their default values. Defaults are described in the overview of `settings <./SettingsOverview.md>`__. A selection of impactful defaults is given below:

The `examples folder <https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/tree/master/Examples>`__ contains scripts illustrating how to use settings to:

- Predict a gait pattern resulting from a limited number of muscle synergies.
- Predict gait with assistance from an ankle exoskeleton.
- Run a sensitivity analysis.
