Predictive Simulations of Human Movement
============

This repository is a rework of the code and data to generate three-dimensional muscle-driven predictive simulations of human gait as described in: Falisse A, Serrancoli G, Dembia C, Gillis J, Jonkers J, De Groote F. 2019 Rapid predictive simulations with complex musculoskeletal models suggest that diverse healthy and pathological human gaits can emerge from similar control strategies. Journal of the Royal Society Interface 16: 20190402. http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0402. You can find the original repository here: https://github.com/antoinefalisse/3dpredictsim

In general, hard coded variables were removed as much as possible and put in a settings structure the user can adapt. This results in:

- More easily use a diffent model (other number of joints or muscles)
- Make input-output a bit easier
- More easily change the (musculo-skeletal) parameters of the simulation

Besides that, the code was also adapted in accordance with recent (October 2020) adjustments in the original repository of Falisse et al.

- Adjusted version of the collocation scheme (now really being an orthogonal radau scheme)
- Support for parallel computing
- Formulation with opti

Lastly, seperate pieces of code where put together to streamline performing predictive simulations:

- Automatic conversion of an OpenSim model to the external function (executable called from the workflow)
- Perorming Muscle Analysis and polynomial fitting (integrated into the workflow)
