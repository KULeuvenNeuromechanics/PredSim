Predictive Simulations of Human Movement
============

This repository contains code and data to generate three-dimensional muscle-driven predictive simulations of human gait. The simulation framework is [developed by Falisse *et al.*](#citations). The implementation in this repo is aimed at letting you run simulations with your customized musculoskeletal models[*](#before-running-a-simulations).
If you want to reproduce specific published results, you are adviced to visit the [repo corresponding to the paper](#citations).

This repository is a work in progress
- If you encounter an error or get an unexpected output, [check the issues](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/issues). Please look at the existing issues before creating a new one, you might not be the first person to have this problem. Include the error messages in the issue.
- Feel free to suggest improvements. Submit a pull request with the changes, or create an issue with a desciption of the proposed change.

### If you are familiar with a previous version of this simulation framework, here is a rundown of the changes

In general, hard coded variables were removed as much as possible and put in a settings structure the user can adapt. This results in:

- More easily use a different model (other number of joints or muscles)
- Make input-output a bit easier
- More easily change the (musculo-skeletal) parameters of the simulation

Besides that, the code was also adapted in accordance with recent (October 2020) adjustments in the original repository of Falisse et al.

- Adjusted version of the collocation scheme (now really being an orthogonal radau scheme)
- Support for parallel computing
- Formulation with opti

Lastly, seperate pieces of code were put together to streamline performing predictive simulations:

- Automatic conversion of an OpenSim model to the external function (executable called from the workflow)
- Perorming Muscle Analysis and polynomial fitting (integrated into the workflow)

## Required software

To run this code you need to have the following softwares on your machine:

- MATLAB. [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) is required. [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) is optional. The code has mainly been developed and tested on MATLAB 2021b, but is expected to run on any recent version.
- [OpenSim](https://simtk.org/projects/opensim) 4.3 or later. Older versions do not work.
- [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/get/). The code has been tested on CasADi 3.5.5.
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). In Visual Studio Installer, [select to include Desktop development with C++](/FiguresForDocumentation/fig_MSVS.png). The code has been tested on MSVS Community 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). The code has been tested on CMake 3.22.0.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). The code has been tested on Git 2.40.0.windows.1. Add Git to your system Path.


## How to setup the code


1. Fork this repository to your github account. If you want the fork to be private, follow [these steps](PrivateForkPredSim.md) instead.
2. Clone the fork to your machine. If you have a computer with restricted permissions, make sure you have permission to run executables from the selected folder (For computers with KU Leuven BioMed Group policies, this is C:\GBW_MyPrograms\ ).
*Do not download the code as zip.*
3. Get the OpenSim API running on MATLAB. See [Setting up your Matlab Scripting Environment](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+with+Matlab#ScriptingwithMatlab-MatlabSetupSettingupyourMatlabScriptingEnvironment).
4. In main.m, change [S.solver.CasADi_path](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/9fbbd43cf83617620e428d2c91f222c909a1349c/main.m#L84) to reflect the location where you installed CasADi. 
5. Make sure the opensimAD submodule is installed. If PredSim\opensimAD\ is empty, open git command prompt, go to ...\PredSim\ , and run `git submodule update --init`.


After perfoming these steps, run the main script. (Expected run time is 40 minutes, depending on hardware.) If you don't receive any errors, your results should be the same as https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/tree/master/Tests/Falisse_et_al_2022_Results. If that is the case, you have succesfully intalled and set up the code. You are ready to do your own simulations.

## How to use the code

The code is written such that as a user you only have to interact with [*main.m*](./main.m).  

All user-defined settings are stored in structure *S*. In main.m you have to specify the required settings and are free to change/add the optional settings. 

### Before running a simulations

This code can automatically convert an OpenSim model to the external function used in the simulations. This greatly simplifies the process of going from a subject-specific model to a predictive simulation. Nevertheless, you should take care of the model you use since **not all OpenSim models are suported**: 
- Model should be 3D.
- Your model should not have locked joints. Locked joints would technically require having kinematic constraints, which is possible but makes the problem more complicated. Replace them with weld joints instead.
- Constraints on coordinates will be ignored (eg, coupling constraints).
- Using SimmSplines to describe coordinates (e.g. Yamaguchi knee model) is not supported as the implementation in OpenSim is not really compatible with algorithmic differentiation. Change them to Polynomials instead. GeometryPaths can contain SimmSplines. [_AdaptOpenSimModel.m_](https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim/blob/master/AdaptOpenSimModel/AdaptOpenSimModel.m) takes care of changing present SimmSplines to polynomials.
- Your model needs to have contact elements that interact with the ground. Only *SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce* contact forces are supported. You can use [_AdaptOpenSimModel.m_](./AdaptOpenSimModel/AdaptOpenSimModel.m) to add contact geometries and forces to your model. You can also scale the radius, stiffness and dissipation of the contact spheres.
- Your model can have any Hill-type muscle model, but it will be implemented as a [DeGroote-Fregly muscle](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-016-1591-9).
- Torque/force actuators of the class *ActivationCoordinateActuator* are supported. You can add actuators by running [_AdaptOpenSimModel.m_](./AdaptOpenSimModel/AdaptOpenSimModel.m). Actuators are not required.

The table should contain a column with coordinate names (header: name), 4 columns with stiffness coefficients, (headers: K_1, K_2, K_3, K_4), and 2 columns with offset coefficients (headers: theta_1, theta_2).
	Limit torques are calculated in function of coordinate value q as: `Tau = K(1)*exp(K(2)*(q-theta(2))) + K(3)*exp(K(4)*(q-theta(1)))`.
	Default coefficients are taken from *Anderson III, Frank Clayton. A dynamic optimization solution for a complete cycle of normal gait. The University of Texas at Austin, 1999.*
- **S.subject.scale_default_coord_lim_torq**:
	- scale factor for the amplitude of *all* default coordinate limit torques. Default is empty [double].
	All `K(1)` and `K(3)` values read from the file with default coefficients are multiplied by this factor.
	To scale the limit torques for individual degrees of freedom, use *S.subject.set_limit_torque_coefficients_selected_dofs*.
- **S.subject.set_limit_torque_coefficients_selected_dofs**: 
	- Set limit torque coefficients for a coordinate. Default is empty [cell array] with pattern {coordinate name(s) [char, cell array of chars], K [4x1 double], theta [2x1 double]}.
	For the specified coordinates, the coefficients from this setting take priority over the coefficients from the file with defaults (*S.subject.default_coord_lim_torq_coeff*).
	Note: Setting `K(1) = nan` will cause the limit torque for that coordinate to be excluded, even if it was given in the defaults.
- **S.subject.base_joints_legs**:
	- Joint name that is the base of a leg, left and right. Default is 'hip' [char]. Inputs of the form 'hip_r', {'hip_l'}, {'hip_r','hip_l'} are equivalent.
- **S.subject.base_joints_arms**:
	- Joint name that is the base of an arm, left and right. Default is 'acromial' [char]. Inputs of the form 'acromial_r', {'acromial_l'}, {'acromial_r','acromial_l'} are equivalent. Set to empty [] if the model does not have arms.
- **S.subject.stiffness_all_ligaments**:
	- Default stiffness model (i.e. force-length) used for ligaments. Default is [*ligamentGefen2002*](./ModelComponents/ligamentGefen2002.m) [char]
- **S.subject.set_stiffness_selected_ligaments**:
	- Use name-value pairs to use different stiffness models for specific ligaments. Default is *{'PlantarFascia',['plantarFasciaNatali2010'](./ModelComponents/plantarFasciaNatali2010.m)}* 

#### S.weights

- **S.weights.E**: 
	- weight on metabolic energy rate. Default is *500* [double]
- **S.weights.E_exp**: 
	- exponent for the metabolic energy rate. Default is *2* [double]
- **S.weights.q_dotdot**: 
	- weight on joint accelerations. Default is *50000* [double]
- **S.weights.e_arm**: 
	- weight on arm excitations. Default is *10^6* [double]
- **S.weights.pass_torq**: 
	- weight on passive torques. Default is *1000* [double]
- **S.weights.pass_torq_includes_damping**: 
	- specify if damping torque = damping coefficient * coordinate velocity is to be included in the cost function (0 or 1). Default is 0 [double].
- **S.weights.a**: 
	- weight on muscle activations. Default is *2000* [double]
- **S.weights.slack_ctrl**: 
	- weight on slack controls. Default is *0.001* [double]

#### S.OpenSimADOptions
These settings are passed to OpenSimAD.

- **S.OpenSimADOptions.compiler**: 
	- command prompt argument for the compiler. [char]
	By default, PredSim will look for the most recent version that is installed in either `C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/` or `C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/`.
   	If you get an error about not finding a compiler, use this setting to specify your compiler:
       - Visual studio 2015: 'Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64'
       - Visual studio 2017: 'Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64'
       - Visual studio 2017: 'Visual Studio 16 2019'
       - Visual studio 2017: 'Visual Studio 17 2022'
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.verbose_mode**:
	- print outputs from windows command prompt to matlab command window (and log file). Default is *true* [bool].
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.verify_ID**:
	- verify the generated function versus the inverse dynamics tool in OpenSim. Default is *false* [bool].
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.jointsOrder**: 
	- If you want to choose the order of the joints outputs. Default is empty, which uses the joint order of the .osim file. [cell array of char]
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.coordinatesOrder**: 
	- If you want to choose the order of the coordinate outputs. Default is empty, which uses the coordinate order of the .osim file. [cell array of char]
	S.OpenSimADOptions.jointsOrder and S.OpenSimADOptions.coordinatesOrder are included in the settings to aid backward compatibility.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.input3DBodyForces**:
	- add 3D force vectors that act on bodies. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.input3DBodyMoments**:
	- add 3D moment vectors that act on bodies. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.export3DPositions**:
	- export 3D position of points in bodies, in ground reference frame. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
- **S.OpenSimADOptions.export3DVelocities**:
	- export 3D velocity of points in bodies, in ground reference frame. Default is empty. Needs further implementations before this can be used.
