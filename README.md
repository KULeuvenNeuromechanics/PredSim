This repository contains code and data to generate three-dimensional muscle-driven predictive simulations of locomotion. The simulation framework is [developed by Falisse *et al.*](#references). The implementation in this repo is aimed at letting you run simulations with your customized musculoskeletal models[*](#before-running-a-simulation).
If you want to reproduce specific published results, see [Replicate results](#replicate-results).

## Required software

To run this code you need to have the following softwares on your machine:

- MATLAB. [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) and [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) are required. [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) is optional. The code has mainly been developed and tested on MATLAB 2021b, but is expected to run on any recent version.
- [OpenSim](https://simtk.org/projects/opensim) 4.3 or later. Older versions do not work.
- [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/get/). The code has been tested on CasADi 3.5.5 and later.
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). In Visual Studio Installer, [select to include Desktop development with C++](./Documentation/FiguresForDocumentation/fig_MSVS.png). The code has been tested on MSVS Community 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). The code has been tested on CMake 3.22.0. Add CMake to your system Path.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). The code has been tested on Git 2.40.0.windows.1. Add Git to your system Path.


## How to setup the code


1. Fork this repository to your github account. If you want the fork to be private, follow [these steps](./Documentation/PrivateForkPredSim.md) instead.
2. Clone the fork to your machine. If you have a computer with restricted permissions, make sure you have permission to run executables from the selected folder (For computers with KU Leuven BioMed Group policies, this is C:\GBW_MyPrograms\ ).
*Do not download the code as zip.*
3. Get the OpenSim API running on MATLAB. See [Setting up your Matlab Scripting Environment](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+with+Matlab#ScriptingwithMatlab-MatlabSetupSettingupyourMatlabScriptingEnvironment).
4. Add the location where you installed CasADi to the matlab search path (`addpath(genpath('C:/path/to/casadi'))`), or use S.solver.CasADi_path. 
5. Make sure the opensimAD submodule is installed. If PredSim\opensimAD\ is empty, open git command prompt, go to ...\PredSim\ , and run `git submodule update --init`.


After perfoming these steps, run the main script. (Expected run time is 40 minutes, depending on hardware.) If you don't receive any errors, your results should be the same as [the reference result](./Tests/ReferenceResults/Falisse_et_al_2022/Falisse_et_al_2022_paper.mat). If that is the case, you have succesfully intalled and set up the code. You are ready to do your own simulations.

## How to use the code

The code is written such that as a user you only have to interact with [*main.m*](./main.m).  

All user-defined [settings](./Documentation/SettingsOverview.md) are stored in structure *S*. In main.m you have to specify the required settings and are free to change/add the optional settings. 


The [examples folder](./Examples/) contains scripts illustrating how to use settings to:
- Predict a gait pattern resulting from a limited number of muscle synergies.
- Predict gait with assistance from an ankle exoskeleton.
- Run a sensitivity analysis.


### Required Settings

- **osim_path**: 
	- Path to the scaled opensim model of the subject. This code can automatically convert an OpenSim model to the external function used in the simulations. This greatly simplifies the process of going from a subject-specific model to a predictive simulation. Nevertheless, you should take care of the model you use since [**not all OpenSim models are suported**](./Documentation/ModelPreparation.md). 
- **S.subject.name**: 
	- The name or code of the subject you are simulating. 
- **S.misc.save_folder**: 
	- Path to the folder where you want to store the simulation results. If the folder does not exist yet on your machine, it will be created automatically.
- **S.solver.IG_selection**: 
	- Either choose 'quasi-random' or give the path to a .mot file you want to use as initial guess. In a quasi-random initial guess, the model is translated forward at the imposed velocity while all other coordinates are kept constant (vertical position of floating base is S.subject.IG_pelvis_y, others are 0). 
- **S.solver.IG_selection_gaitCyclePercent**: 
	- If S.solver.IG_selection is a .mot file, S.solver.IG_selection_gaitCyclePercent is required. Here, specify what percent of gait cycle does the .mot file contain. For example, if the .mot file has 2 gait cycles, S.solver.IG_selection_gaitCyclePercent is 200.

A [full overview of settings](./Documentation/SettingsOverview.md) is available in the documentation.

## Replicate results
